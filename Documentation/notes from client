create an event using the  CREATE EVENT statement:
CREATE EVENT IF NOT EXISTS test_event_01

  INSERT INTO messages(message,created_at)
  VALUES('Test MySQL Event 1',NOW());


To shows all events in the database, you use the following statement:

update next run = current time + interval

when next log reset comes:
update last reset = NOW
update next reset = now + interval
run delete statement
